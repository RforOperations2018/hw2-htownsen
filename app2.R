# HW2 Instructions:
# Directions: Use plotly (with or without the aid of ggplot2) to create three 
# (3) different kinds of figures and one (1) data table. Include at least three (3) types of inputs, 
#one (1) functioning downloadButton() and one (1) observer in the server. On the server side your plots and 
#tables must utilize the reactive function for any and all datasets.
